# **It starts somewhere ...**

So today seems the day when I finally access TheGrid.io beta. I am the most impatient guy on Earth and also versatile. In every possible meaning. At the second, I discover TheGrid, I was a founding member the following second. However, the next minutes I went over and start reading about comments from users... I was hit by remorse. I read that this startup would be the worse beta test ever seen in the history of online startup. I heard that this would never see the light of success and that TheGrid would be a deadspot where money was poor in for greedy founders.  
I was stressed... just a little bit because I remember that I was a startuper co-founder and I needed to trust other creatives people in order for the world to be ready to trust mine.

I slowly emailed the greed with a bit of fear for not getting any emails. Indeed, the first three emails did not find any answers. The real reason is, I was given the wrong email and no failure delivery notifications were send to me. Bummer ! This was made make me feel anxious but in a very French way. I had a tea and a croissant while thinking about this greedy b\*stard stealing my money away while I needed it.

But here I am. In front of my screen, and testing for the first time @TheGrid.
