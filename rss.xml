            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It starts somewhere ...</h1><p>So today seems the day when I finally access TheGrid.io beta. I am the most impatient guy on Earth and also versatile. In every possible meaning. At the second, I discover TheGrid, I was a founding member the following second. However, the next minutes I went over and start reading about comments from users... I was hit by remorse. I read that this startup would be the worse beta test ever seen in the history of online startup. I heard that this would never see the light of success and that TheGrid would be a deadspot where money was poor in for greedy founders.I was stressed... just a little bit because I remember that I was a startuper co-founder and I needed to trust other creatives people in order for the world to be ready to trust mine.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/26976045-9ad4-4cd9-b309-0aaae2b07cf1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
