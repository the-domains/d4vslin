            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It starts somewhere ...</h1><p>So today seems to be the day when I finally have a beta access to TheGrid. I am the most impatient guy on Earth and also versatile. In every possible meaning. At the second, I discover TheGrid, I was a founding member the following second. However, the next minutes I went over and start reading about comments from users... I was hit by remorse. I read that this startup would be the worse beta test ever seen in the history of online startup. I heard that this would never see the light of success and that TheGrid would be a deadspot where money was poor in for greedy founders.I was stressed... just a little bit because I remember that I was a startuper co-founder and I needed to trust other creatives people in order for the world to be ready to trust mine.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5ed002454b6d263cb38de0682cc36a8cb6cd0f6b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
